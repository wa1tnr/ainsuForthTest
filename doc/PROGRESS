  quit.h

All appear to compile and play their roles in a working
Forth (essentially, this is an unmodified YAFFA-ARM Forth
at this juncture).

The purpose of the test version is to compile the src
directory into the Forth, replacing every function that
is commented-out of the original file with the same code
in a separate file (under src/kernel).

In this way, not too much effort is made to port the code
from the base directory into the src/kernel directory,
in an unverified state.

The ideas seem to be producing expected results.

The Adafruit Feather M0 Express is the hardware tested.
An Arduino M0 Pro is also available.

Wanted: the Metro version of the M0 Express.

NOTE: The obvious difference between the test directory
and the regular one is that the regular one does no
work -- most of the code in it is commented out.  In
the test directory, that is not the case -- all the
code is present -- it is a working Forth.
